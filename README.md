# The Jackbox Party Pack 3

## What is JACKBOX Party Pack 3?

The threequel to the party game phenomenon features the deadly quiz show Trivia Murder Party, the say-anything sequel Quiplash 2, the surprising survey game Guesspionage, the t-shirt slugfest Tee K.O., and the sneaky trickster game Fakin’ It.

## Download

You can download from Steam [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/434170/The_Jackbox_Party_Pack_3/).

## Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you open up the application, you will be presetned with a screen like this:

Once you are passed the main screen (shown above) you will be given the choice to select from one of the five games!

Your five options are: Quiplash, Trivia Murder Party, Tee K.O., Guesspionage, and Fakin' it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quiplash 2

Quiplash 2 is the gut-busting battle of wits and wittiness! Just use your phone or tablet (no controllers needed) to answer simple prompts like these:

* Something you’d be surprised to see a donkey do
* A double rainbow doesn’t have gold at the end of it Instead, it has ______.
* A better name for France

# Trivia Murder Party

Waaaaake Up! It’s time to play Trivia Murder Party, a deadly quiz show where you match wits with a trivia-obsessed killer.

Answer trivia questions correctly in each round or you’ll find yourself on The Killing Floor, where players compete in devious minigames that determine whether they survive another round or become a ghost. But relax, ghosts can still win the game. (The host is evil, but he still cares about balanced game design.)

# Tee K.O.

Welcome to mysterious T-Shirt Island, where the most hardened warriors in the world join you to compete in an ancient and deadly fighting tournament. Only you won’t be fighting with fists. Instead, you engage each other in a battle of… t-shirts.

# Guesspionage

Guesspionage tests your knowledge of the human condition as you guess how real people responded to basic poll questions like:
* “What percentage of people have mistaken mannequins for real people?” 

* “What percentage of adults have played Truth or Dare after turning 30?”

# Fakin' it

In Fakin’ It, you can FINALLY discover how bad your friends are at lying, without any relationship-ending arguments!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Game Room

Once you have decided what game you would like to select, you enter a waiting room. There will be a 4-digit code that the user would have to enter (correctly) along with a name to join the room.

The first person to join the room is the "VIP." There are no benefits to the VIP in this game. However, they make the call on when the game begins (from the waiting room), and have control on whether they want to skip the intro video once they started the game.

Each game has its own limit of how many people can join. With that being said, if the maximum number of players join the room for the game, then others can still join but they will join as an audience.

The waiting screen should look as follows:

# Play

## FAQ

What do I do after my character has been created?

Once your character is created you wait for the VIP to start the games! The game does a great job explaining the games you are about to play. The game is not meant to be difficult, but rather purley for entertainment!
